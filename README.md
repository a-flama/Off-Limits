# Off-Limits

### In this lab.. I learned how to: 
- Launch a Directory Traversal attack on an FTP server by modifying a bash script (attack.sh) to utilize attack.js.
- Analyze a .pcap file of server traffic to identify files accessed without proper permissions through the Directory Traversal attack.
- Successfully identify specific sensitive files (rocknames.txt, reports_original.txt, passwords.txt) that were accessed.
